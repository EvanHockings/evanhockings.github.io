Welcome to my blog! 
<!-- I cannot promise to write here all that regularly, but I hope to share my research and thoughts on quantum computing and AI existential safety. -->

<!-- Why am I interested in AI existential safety, given that my research currently focuses on quantum computing?
In short, I have concerningly similar median estimates for when we will achieve useful fault-tolerant quantum computation, and when AI systems will be able to automate almost all human-level computer-based cognitive tasks---on the order of a decade for both.
Even [relatively conservative accountings](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/what-a-compute-centric-framework-says-about-takeoff-speeds/) suggest that the transition between little and full automation might only take three years.
This alone is sufficient cause for concern.
But we also have an very limited ability to understand and interpret the inner functions of machine learning systems, despite full access to their parameters and code.
Nor do we know how to robustly align the behaviour of superhuman AI systems with whatever goals we might like to specify, especially because humans will not be able to reliably supervise such systems.

I find this extremely concerning.
Since I [wrote about](https://honisoit.com/2022/10/the-risks-posed-by-artificial-intelligence-demand-serious-consideration/) these concerns last year, the release of ChatGPT has fuelled a surge in public attention on the existential risks posed by powerful AI systems.
Whille this attention is heartening, and I am especially pleased with the [rapid progress](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-taskforce-first-progress-report/frontier-ai-taskforce-first-progress-report) made by the UK's Frontier AI Taskforce, many causes for concern remain.
I hope to write about and work on these issues in the future. -->
